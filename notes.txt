To start program at startup:

On stretch versions before 11/18 (i.e. 2018-10-09-raspbian-stretch.img):
   edit /home/pi/.config/lxsessions/LXDE/autostart

   make it look like:
   sudo gpsd /dev/ttyS0 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock
   DISPLAY=:0
   sudo /usr/bin/python /home/pi/Code/adway-controller/display_images.py

Not sure how to do autostart on newer versions of stretch - still looking
EDIT: apparently, this will still work, but 
It's the still the same, but you have to copy in the contents of the global autostart file (/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart)
It's still the same BUT they haven't included the directories or the autostart file, you need to do that yourself or go back to the xdg version. Will investigate further

To run the program as it currently exists on a Pi:

sudo apt-get install feh
sudo apt-get install python-bluez
pip install --user psutil
sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev libbluetooth-dev
pip install --user bluepy
sudo pip install bluepy
wget ftp://ftp.digifail.com/software/bluelog/bluelog-1.1.2.tar.gz
tar xzvf bluelog-1.1.2.tar.gz
cd bluelog-1.1.2
make
sudo make install

sudo raspi-config
enable camera

To create a demo version:
edit the autostart file as above
mkdir Code
mkdir Code/adway-controller
mkdir ADWAY
mkdir ADWAY/AA
mkdir ADWAY/AD
mkdir ADWAY/JP
mkdir ADWAY/web
mkdir ADWAY/logo
mkdir ADWAY/lakers   (subject to change, edit display-images accordingly)
copy over display_images.py as well as appropriate images (P or D) into image folders

To enable the GPS:
Vin on the GPS -> 3.3V on the Pi
GND -> GND
Rx -> pin 8
Tx -> pin 10

In raspi-config: disable serial port (this is necessary to free up /dev/ttyS0)

You also have to disable the gpsd systemctl:

sudo systemctl stop gpsd.socket
sudo systemctl disable gpsd.socket

In terminal:
sudo gpsd /dev/ttyS0 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock

cgps -s

will let you know if you have a fix

sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev
