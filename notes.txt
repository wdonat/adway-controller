To start program at startup:

On stretch versions before 11/18:
   edit /home/pi/.config/lxsessions/LXDE/autostart

   make it look like:
   DISPLAY=:0
   /usr/bin/python /home/pi/Code/adway-controller/display_images.py

Not sure how to do autostart on newer versions of stretch - still looking

To run the program as it currently exists on a Pi:

sudo apt-get install feh
sudo apt-get install python-bluez
pip install --user psutil

sudo raspi-config
enable camera

To create a demo version:
edit the autostart file as above
mkdir Code
mkdir Code/adway-controller
mkdir ADWAY
mkdir ADWAY/AA
mkdir ADWAY/AD
mkdir ADWAY/JP
mkdir ADWAY/web
mkdir ADWAY/logo
mkdir ADWAY/lakers   (subject to change, edit display-images accordingly)
copy over display_images.py as well as appropriate images (P or D) into image folders
